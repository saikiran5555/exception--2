    "Be specific in exception handling: Catch only the exceptions that you can handle and let others propagate. This helps in maintaining clarity and avoiding unintentional errors. Avoid using broad exception handlers like except Exception: unless absolutely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle exceptions at the right level: Place exception handling code at the appropriate level of abstraction. Handle exceptions where you have the necessary context and can take appropriate actions or provide meaningful error messages. Avoid catching exceptions too high up in the call stack, as it can lead to unclear error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use multiple except blocks: When catching multiple exceptions, use separate except blocks for each exception. This allows you to handle different exceptions differently, providing specific error handling or recovery mechanisms for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid bare except: Avoid using except: without specifying the exception type. It makes it difficult to identify the specific exception being caught and can lead to unexpected behaviors or hide bugs. Instead, catch specific exceptions or at least use except Exception: to handle a broader range of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean up with finally: Use the finally block to perform cleanup operations, such as releasing resources or closing files, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. The finally block ensures that the cleanup code is executed, providing a reliable way to release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use logging for error information: Instead of printing error messages directly to the console, consider using a logging framework (e.g., Python's built-in logging module) to log error information. Logging provides more flexibility, allows you to configure different logging levels, and helps in debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reraise or raise a new exception: In some cases, it might be appropriate to catch an exception, perform some additional actions, and then reraise the same exception or raise a new exception. This allows you to add more context or handle exceptions at different levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid excessive nesting: Keep exception handling code as flat as possible and avoid excessive nesting. Excessive nesting can make the code harder to read and maintain. Consider refactoring complex exception handling logic into separate functions or context managers for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document exception behavior: When defining custom exceptions, document their behavior, including the conditions under which they are raised and any special considerations for handling them. This helps other developers understand the purpose and usage of your custom exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers (with statement) whenever applicable to ensure proper resource management and automatic cleanup. Context managers simplify exception handling by automatically taking care of resource cleanup when leaving the context, even in the presence of exceptions."
